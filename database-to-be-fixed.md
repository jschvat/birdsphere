 I've completed the analysis of all PostgreSQL stored procedures and triggers in your
  BirdSphere database. Here are my findings:

  Malfunctioning Procedures:

  1. get_comments_with_media - CONFIRMED BROKEN ✗
    - Issue: Type mismatch errors causing HTTP 500
    - Error: "Returned type uuid does not match expected type character varying in column 5"
    - Status: Already bypassed in our fix by enhancing the regular comments endpoint
    - Recommendation: Should be either fixed or removed entirely

  Working Procedures & Triggers:

  2. extract_hashtags_and_keywords - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Extracts hashtags and search keywords from content
    - Logic: Uses regex to find hashtags (#word) and extract keywords >2 chars
    - Status: Well-structured and should work correctly
  3. update_comment_count - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Maintains comment_count on posts and reply_count on comments
    - Logic: Increments on INSERT, decrements on DELETE
    - Trigger: Missing - This function exists but no trigger uses it
    - Status: Code is correct but likely not being used
  4. update_comment_media_flag - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Maintains has_media flag on comments
    - Logic: Sets TRUE on media INSERT, checks remaining media on DELETE
    - Trigger: ✓ update_comment_media_flag_trigger exists
    - Status: Active and functional
  5. update_reaction_count - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Maintains reaction_count on posts/comments
    - Logic: Handles both post and comment reactions
    - Trigger: Missing - Function exists but no trigger uses it
    - Status: Code is correct but likely not being used
  6. update_engagement_score - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Calculates engagement scores with recency boost
    - Logic: Weighted formula with time-based decay
    - Trigger: Missing - Function exists but no trigger uses it
    - Status: Code is correct but likely not being used
  7. update_updated_at - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Sets updated_at timestamp using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    - Trigger: ✓ Active on comments table
    - Status: Active and functional
  8. update_updated_at_column - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Sets updated_at timestamp using NOW()
    - Trigger: ✓ Active on posts table
    - Status: Active and functional
  9. update_user_rating - FUNCTIONAL ✓
    - Purpose: Maintains avg rating and rating_count on users
    - Logic: Calculates average from user_ratings table
    - Trigger: ✓ trigger_update_user_rating exists
    - Status: Active and functional

  Missing Triggers (Potential Issues):

  - update_comment_count: No trigger found - comment counts may be inaccurate
  - update_reaction_count: No trigger found - reaction counts may be inaccurate
  - update_engagement_score: No trigger found - engagement scores not being calculated
  - extract_hashtags_and_keywords: No trigger found - hashtags/keywords not being extracted

  Summary:

  - 1 Confirmed Broken: get_comments_with_media (already bypassed)
  - 8 Functional Procedures: All have correct logic
  - 4 Active Triggers: Working properly
  - 4 Missing Triggers: Functions exist but aren't being used

  The main issue was the get_comments_with_media function which we've already worked around.
   The other functions appear technically sound but some may not be active due to missing
  triggers.
