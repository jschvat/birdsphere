## Test Results by Endpoint

### ✅ PASSED TESTS (2/7)

#### 1. POST /api/media/upload - Media Upload for Posts
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Response Code:** 200 OK
**Test Data:** Text file upload
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "1 file(s) uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "files": [{
      "id": "adf1311e-a861-499e-99aa-2833e4a59e53",
      "filename": "4674383a-309f-408e-94d4-26972e79fc2d.txt",
      "originalName": "test_media.txt",
      "mimetype": "text/plain",
      "size": 19,
      "category": "document",
      "url": "/uploads/4674383a-309f-408e-94d4-26972e79fc2d.txt"
    }],
    "totalSize": 19,
    "categories": ["document"]
  }
}
```
**Notes:** Media upload works perfectly with correct field name ("files")

#### 2. GET /api/media/limits - Get Upload Limits
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Response Code:** 200 OK
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {

    "maxFileSizeFormatted": "50 MB",
    "maxFiles": 20,
    "allowedTypes": {
      "images": ["jpeg","jpg","png","webp","gif","svg"],
      "videos": ["mp4","mpeg","quicktime","webm","avi","mov"],
      "documents": ["pdf","doc","docx","xls","xlsx","ppt","pptx","txt","csv","rtf"],
      "models": ["skp","stl","obj","fbx","dae","ply","3ds","gltf","glb"],
      "archives": ["zip","rar","7z"]
    }

### ❌ FAILED TESTS (5/7)

#### 1. POST /api/posts/ - Create Post
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Response Code:** 500 Internal Server Error
**Error:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to create post",
  "error": "Post validation failed: author: Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"4371cb43-515e-4384-bc02-3ec138280e51\" (type string) at path \"author\" because of \"BSONError\""
}
```
**Root Cause:** MongoDB ObjectId vs PostgreSQL UUID mismatch
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Core functionality broken

#### 2. POST /api/posts/:id/react - React to Post
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Response Code:** 500 Internal Server Error
**Error:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to react to post",
  "error": "Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"test-post-id\" (type string) at path \"_id\" for model \"Post\""
}
```
**Root Cause:** Same ObjectId/UUID mismatch
**Initial Issue:** Used wrong field name ("type" instead of "reactionType") - FIXED
**Valid Reaction Types:** like, love, laugh, wow, sad, angry, hug

#### 3. POST /api/posts/:id/share - Share Post
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Response Code:** 500 Internal Server Error
**Error:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to share post",
  "error": "Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"test-post-id\" (type string) at path \"_id\" for model \"Post\""
}
```
**Root Cause:** Same ObjectId/UUID mismatch

#### 4. POST /api/posts/:postId/comments - Create Comment
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Response Code:** 500 Internal Server Error
**Error:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to create comment",
  "error": "Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"test-post-id\" (type string) at path \"_id\" for model \"Post\""
}
```
**Root Cause:** Same ObjectId/UUID mismatch

#### 5. GET /api/posts - Get Posts (Discovery Test)
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Response Code:** 404 Not Found
**Error:**
```json
{
  "error": "Route not found",
  "path": "/api/posts"
}
```
**Root Cause:** No GET route implemented for posts listing

## Minor Issues Discovered

### Media Upload Field Name Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Initial Error:** "Unexpected file field" when using field name "media"
- **Solution:** Use field name "files" as expected by multer configuration
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Reaction Type Field Name Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Initial Error:** "Invalid reaction type" when using field "type"
- **Solution:** Use field name "reactionType" as expected by validation
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Technical Analysis

### Database Architecture Mismatch
The primary issue is a fundamental architectural mismatch:
- **User System:** PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys
- **Posts System:** MongoDB with ObjectId primary keys
- **Impact:** Complete incompatibility between user auth and posting functionality

### Working Components
- Authentication system (PostgreSQL-based)
- Media upload system (file storage)
- Validation middleware (field validation works)
- Rate limiting and security headers

### Broken Components
- Post creation and management
- Post reactions and sharing
- Comment system
- Any cross-references between users and posts

## Security Notes
- JWT authentication working correctly
- File upload validation operational
- Rate limiting active (1000 requests/15min window)
- Security headers properly configured
- No sensitive data exposure in error messages

## Performance Notes
- API response times: < 100ms for working endpoints
- File upload handling efficient
- Error handling graceful (no crashes)
